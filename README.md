# Amulet Minecraft Map Editor - Flatpak Edition
My hope, with this project, is to make Amulet easier to install and use for people who aren't used to tinkering with source repositories, or don't have experience with programming, and might not be comfortable attempting to install dependencies and run thigs from source, or through the terminal.

Since the guide at https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/how-install-and-use-flatpak-linux/ is so well done, there's no need for me to go over the installation and setup of Flatpak.

The `amulet.flatpak` file is the actual flatpak application and can be downloaded and run locally if you have the Flatpak framework installed by simply running `flatpak install amulet.flatpak` from the terminal, then run with `flatpak run com.github.amulet_map_editor`. Uninstall is equally simplistic, achieved by running `flatpak uninstall com.github.amulet_map_editor`.

Assuming this works as intended accross the spectrum of Linux distributions, this project will be handed over to the Amulet team to manage officially.

The initial Flatpak version was sourced from Amulet 0.10.34.
